This is a classic Snake game built using JavaFX, a popular framework for building desktop applications with Java. 

## How to run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using 
```
git clone https://github.com/FlorianIanculescu/Snake.git
```
2. Open the project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE), such as IntelliJ or Eclipse
    
3. Build and run the project

## Features

  - The game has a graphical user interface built using [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/), which makes it easy and intuitive to play 
  - The game is built using object-oriented programming principles, which makes it easy to extend and modify
  
## How to play

  - The game starts with a small snake on the screen.
  - You are asked to press a start button or key.
  - Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to steer the snake in the desired direction.
  - You'll see food items (small fruits) randomly placed on the screen. Direct your snake to "eat" these food items by moving over them. Each time the snake consumes food, it grows longer, each fruit having a different value
  - As the snake eats more food, it will increase in length. Growing the snake is a key aspect of the game, but it also makes maneuvering more challenging.
  - The game ends if the snake collides with:
    - The walls or screen boundaries.
    - Its own tail.
  - After the game ends, you can usually start a new round by pressing a restart button.
